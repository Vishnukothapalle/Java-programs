Dear John and Jane,

I hope you both are doing well. It's been a while since I've seen you. I wanted to invite you to my and my wife's anniversary party next Friday, March 12th. We'll be celebrating our 10th anniversary, and it would mean the world to us if you could make it.

The party will take place at our house, located at 123 Oak Street. It's going to be a backyard barbecue, so please bring your appetite! We'll be serving delicious food and drinks, and there will be music for dancing.

Please RSVP by March 5th so we can make sure to have enough food and drinks for everyone. You can reach me at 555-123-4567 or email me at johnandjane@example.com to let us know if you can attend.

We look forward to seeing you, and we hope you can come and join us in celebrating this special occasion.

Best regards,
John and Jane Doe
